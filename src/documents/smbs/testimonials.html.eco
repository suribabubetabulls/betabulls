                 <p>"BetaBulls did a good job focusing on delivery of the solution and working within our
                 budget and the inevitable scope creep that occurs when hands-on experience with new things
                 leads to new, great ideas... BetaBulls had a great attitude and energy and never stopped
                 working for the end goal."</p>
